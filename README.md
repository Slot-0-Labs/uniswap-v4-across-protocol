<img src="./argos.png" alt="odyssey_gif" width="50%" />

Welcome to the Argos Protocol V1, an innovative platform designed to revolutionize cross-chain swaps by integrating Uniswap V4 and Across Protocol technologies. Argos Protocol embodies a seamless, efficient, and secure method for transferring assets across different blockchain networks.

## ü¶Ñ Uniswap V4: The Core of Argos Protocol

Uniswap V4, a cornerstone of Argos Protocol, is a cutting-edge Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol. Key aspects include:

- **Non-custodial, Non-upgradeable, Permissionless**: Built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it offers robust security and user autonomy.
- **Advanced Features**: Incorporates architectural enhancements over previous versions (V1, V2, and the concentrated liquidity model in V3).
- **Innovative Capabilities**: Includes hooks, singleton, flash accounting, and native ETH support for an optimized trading experience.

## üåâ Across Protocol: Bridging Chains in Argos

Across Protocol complements Argos by providing a trust-minimized bridge. Its features are:

- **Secure Asset Transfer**: Utilizes a network of relayers and an Optimistic Oracle for secure, efficient transfers between Ethereum and its Layer 2s.
- **UBA Fee Model**: Balances liquidity across chains, enhancing the efficiency of cross-chain interactions.

## üîÄ Argos's Cross-Chain Swapping Mechanics

Argos Protocol V1 leverages Uniswap V4 and Across Protocol to facilitate efficient cross-chain swaps:

1. **Initiation**: User starts a swap on Chain A in a Uniswap V4 pool integrated with Argos's Cross-Chain Swap Hook.
2. **Bridge Transfer**: The beforeSwap hook on Chain A initiates a bridge transfer to Chain B via Across Protocol.
3. **Relayer Interaction**: Across Protocol relayers provide equivalent tokens on Chain B.
4. **Execution and Completion**: Swaps are executed on Chain B, followed by afterSwap actions on both chains.
5. **Optimistic Oracle Verification**: Ensures the validity of the swap and relayer reimbursement.

## üö© Current Challenges in Argos V1

While Argos Protocol V1 marks a significant milestone, we are actively addressing these challenges:

- **Balance Delta Handling**: Ensuring zero balance delta at the end of transactions on each chain.
- **Gas Costs**: Optimizing transactions to reduce gas fees associated with cross-chain transfers.
- **Liquidity Pool Balance**: Maintaining equilibrium in liquidity pools to prevent slippage and other issues.
